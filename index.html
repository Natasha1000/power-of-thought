<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p style="font-size:1.25rem">This is a test and under construction.</p>
<br>
<p>How I started my journey on self improvement, how I got where I am and how long I have been studying. What got through to me when in the past other things had not...ie Tony Robbins book in 2008/2010 had a short term impact but did not last. However the lecture from Bob Proctor resonated and clicked with me as it was someone who came from nothing but also communicated in a way that made me listen. We can't just read something once and expect to coherently understand and also change in the same way as we don't brush our teeth just once and expect them to be clean forever. It is an ongoing pursuit like going to the gym we need to have the same attitude with regards to feeeding our minds with positive information that enghances our experience of life especially where in the world there are many signals and messages telling us contary things. We must active;u work at looking after our minds and what goes in on a daily basis.</p>
